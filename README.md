# ITEC_2905_Capstone

This is my Capstone project. 
The goal of this program is to reduce the time wasted by guardianship attorneys when they have to update files on their PC. This program will find and download those files for them. 

This project will find Emails based on a chosen sting set by the user and found in the subject line of the email. It will then open emails selected by the program and download any attachments it finds to the selected 
location. 

When the program finds a file that it needs to replace on the computer it will delete the file and then download the new file with the same name. If no file to replace is found the program will download the file from the email anyways. 

The program has a Login screen that curently must be set manually for the email address and password the user needs. The login screen mainly stops the program from crashing when the wrong username and password are given. 

To use, download 'Capstone Project' and open in a compiler.
